# Indian_Flight_Fare_Prediction

# Overview
Accurate flight fare predictions empower travelers to make well-informed choices on departure schedules, layovers, and airlines, optimizing time management and travel convenience. 
This revolutionizes travel planning benefiting both individuals and the flight industry, significantly enhancing the travel experience, optimizing both time management and cost-efficiency. 

# Components
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Analysis
Machine Learning Model
Comparing the models

# Steps:
1. Effectively explore and dissect the flight fare dataset to derive meaningful insights from data.
2. Start uncovering patterns and trends that help us understand the factors influencing flight fares.
3. Select the best model that will help in exploring techniques to compare various ML models.
4. Explore the one that performs optimally for predicting flight fares.
5. Identify that has the high accuracy from the optimal model.
