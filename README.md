# Indian_Flight_Fare_Prediction

# Overview
Accurate flight fare predictions empower travelers to make well-informed choices on departure schedules, layovers, and airlines, optimizing time management and travel convenience. 
This revolutionizes travel planning benefiting both individuals and the flight industry, significantly enhancing the travel experience, optimizing both time management and cost-efficiency. 
This project encompasses the following key steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Effectively explore and dissect the flight fare dataset where EDA is the foundational step in deriving meaningful insights from data both matematically and visually.
Data Analysis: Now start uncovering patterns and trends that help us understand the factors influencing flight fares.
Machine Learning Model: Select the best model that will help in exploring techniques to compare various ML models and choose the one that performs optimally for predicting flight fares.
Usage: Please refer to the documentation and code provided in the respective sections to utilize the tools and insights developed as part of this project.
